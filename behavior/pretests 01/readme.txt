002  - contrast range ended up too wide, gabor fit failed 
       probably or the decision whether it failed or not
003a - contrast fitting failed at some point because 
       contrast stopped at 0.6 although it was too easy
       (subject did not respond when was sure he did not 
       see the stimulus)
003  - went better, but maybe went with contrast too low, 
       (subject did not respond when was sure he did not 
       see the stimulus)
